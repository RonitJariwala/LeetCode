# 📚 LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains all the coding solutions I've implemented for various LeetCode problems, including problems from different difficulty levels and topics such as data structures, algorithms, and more. I update this repository regularly as I solve new problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem type or topic. Each directory contains problem-specific files, which include:
- **Problem Name**: The name of the problem as it appears on LeetCode.
- **Problem Description**: A brief description of the problem, along with the problem number.
- **Solution**: My solution to the problem, written in C++, Python, JavaScript, or any other programming language.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### Folder Descriptions:

- **Arrays/**: Problems related to arrays, searching, sorting, and subarrays.
- **Strings/**: Solutions to string manipulation, substring problems, and pattern matching.
- **Linked Lists/**: Contains problems on singly and doubly linked lists, list manipulation, and operations.
- **Trees/**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and other tree-based problem solutions.
- **Graphs/**: Solutions for graph traversal, shortest paths, and connected components.
- **Dynamic Programming/**: Problems on dynamic programming techniques such as knapsack, LIS, and DP on trees.
- **Recursion/**: Includes problems that use recursion and backtracking techniques.
- **Others/**: Miscellaneous problems that do not fall into the above categories.

## How to Use

Each folder contains C++ solutions for various problems, organized by the problem type. You can navigate to the respective folders to view the solution for a particular problem.
