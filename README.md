# 📚 LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains all the coding solutions I've implemented for various LeetCode problems, including problems from different difficulty levels and topics such as data structures, algorithms, and more. I update this repository regularly as I solve new problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem type or topic. Each directory contains problem-specific files, which include:
- **Problem Name**: The name of the problem as it appears on LeetCode.
- **Problem Description**: A brief description of the problem, along with the problem number.
- **Solution**: My solution to the problem, written in C++, Python, JavaScript, or any other programming language.

### 📁 Folder Structure:

Each folder contains files that correspond to the LeetCode problem solutions, with the filenames generally following the convention:

### Example:

## 📝 Content Overview

I have categorized the problems into different folders based on the problem type:
- **Arrays:** Solutions for array-related problems, including sorting, searching, and manipulation.
- **Strings:** String manipulation, searching, and pattern-matching problems.
- **Linked Lists:** Problems involving singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Trees:** Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and other tree-related problems.
- **Graphs:** Graph traversal, shortest path, and graph connectivity problems.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Optimization problems using dynamic programming.
- **Recursion:** Recursive solutions for problems that involve breaking tasks down.
- **Others:** Miscellaneous problems that don’t fit into specific categories.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the Categories:** Go through the different folders to find solutions for problems in specific topics.
2. **Look for the Problem:** The problem number and name will be in the filename.
3. **Open the File:** Each file contains my approach and implementation of the solution.
4. **Run the Code:** You can copy and paste the code directly into your LeetCode editor or any IDE to run and test.

## 💡 Languages Used

Here are the languages I've used to solve problems:
- C++
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java

I try to write solutions in multiple languages where possible to enhance my problem-solving skills across languages.
